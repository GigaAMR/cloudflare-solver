**If you receive results failed, please try other proxy. The problem should be that  your website is really strict with proxies
Some sites may have stricted checks like only allow USA proxies, DE proxies, or other country proxy.**

Be sure that you use the right demo and the right type.
 
Sometimes, your site may use challenge and not turnstile and viceversa.
Challenge is  like a loading page for 5s and sometimes a turnstile appear
Turnstile is the captcha that only appear on the page, for example a checkout, login, register
